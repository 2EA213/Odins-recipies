        <li>1 TBS olive oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 greel bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds frozen medium shrimp thawed</li>
        <li>8 ounces cooked ham, diced</li>
        <li>1 TS spicey seasoned salt</li>
        <li>1/2 TS garlic salt</li>
        <li>Salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheeses</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add green bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp; cook and stir until pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ham, seasoned salt, garlic salt, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour cream and milk into the saucepan. Continue to cook, stirring often, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in cheese. Let sauce cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add pasta and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 
            1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. 
            Add 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
    </ol>
